        <h1>Best Movie Genre</h1>
        <hr>
        <h4> In my personal opinion I believe that Fantasy is the best movie genre.</h4>

        <ul>
            <h3>The reasons I believe this are:</h3>
            <li>The Star Wars series falls under this genre.</li>
            <li>Fantasy helps people use unrealistic stories to teach lessons.</li>
            <li>The Fantasy genre helps people escape from their life by introducing unrealistic things.</li>
            <li>It gives the writer freedom to do anything with the book.</li>
            <li>Helps people use their imagination when the movie is being written or when it ends on a cliffhanger.</li>

        </ul>

        <h4>My favorite movie is Star Wars especially the origional movies because they give off that classic movie feeling. Here is a movie poster for Star Wars</h4>
