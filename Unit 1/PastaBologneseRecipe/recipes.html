    <h4>Chef's Tips before you start.</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Use a pasta that has a tube shape like rigatoni or penne as the meat sauce will be stuck in the pasta
            obsorbing all the flavor so every bite is as much flavorful as the first.</li>
        <li>Add the pasta directly into the meat sauce so you know the pasta to sauce ratio to make sure you don't end
            up with more sauce than you prefer.</li>
        <li>Save some starch water from when you boiled the pasta to put into the sauce to make the sauce more full of
            flavor.</li>
        <li>Use some herbs like mix of fresh basil and flat leaf parsley to finish off the pasta once it is plated to
            add that freshness that comes from fresh herbs.</li>
        <li>Finish off the dish with freshly grated parmesan cheese to help thicken the sauce and add more flavor.</li>
        <li>Fresh ingredients are always better than preserved or frozen ones.</li>
        <li>Always let the bolognese sauce simmer for about 30 minutes to make sure the sauce gets that deep and rich
            flavor.</li>
