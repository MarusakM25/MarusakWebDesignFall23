        <h2>Who is Vincent van Gogh?</h2>
        <p>- Vincent van Gogh was a Dutch Post-Impressionist painter who is among the most famous and influential
            figures
            in the history of Western art. He created more than 2,000 artworks, mostly in the last decade of his life,

        <h2>How Did He Gain Popularity</h2>
        <p>- Vincent van Gogh became famous after his death, thanks to the efforts of his sister-in-law, Jo van
            Gogh-Bonger, who sold, loaned, and published his works. His art also appealed to the audiences with its
            vibrant colors, expressive brushstrokes, and emotional depth. His life story, marked by struggle and
            tragedy, also fascinated the public and inspired many artists.</p>
        <p>- Another reason why Vincent van Gogh became famous is that his art was influenced by and influenced many other
            artists, such as Paul Gauguin, Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec, and Pablo Picasso. His paintings also captured
            the spirit of the modern era, with its rapid changes, social conflicts, and urbanization. Many say his art
            was very much ahead of its time.</p>
