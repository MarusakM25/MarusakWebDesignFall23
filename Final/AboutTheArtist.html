    <h2>Vincent van Gogh's life</h2>
    <p>Vincent van Gogh was a Dutch painter who lived from 1853 to 1890. He is one of the most famous and
        influential artists of all time. He painted about 2,000 artworks, mostly in the last decade of his life. He used
        bright and expressive colors to show his emotions and vision of the world. Some of his best-known paintings are
        Starry Night, Sunflowers, and Self-Portrait. He also painted landscapes, flowers, portraits, and still lifes.
    </p>

    <p>Van Gogh had a difficult and lonely life. He suffered from mental illness and had few friends. He often
        struggled with poverty and illness. He only sold one painting during his lifetime. He died at the age of 37 from
        a self-inflicted gunshot wound. His brother Theo, who supported him throughout his life, died six months later.
        Van Gogh's work became famous after his death, thanks to the efforts of his sister-in-law Johanna, who collected
        and exhibited his paintings. Today, his paintings are among the most expensive and admired in the world.</p>
