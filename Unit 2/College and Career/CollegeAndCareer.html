    <h3> My First choice college for Pre-med and Med</h3>
    
        <h4>For Pre-med I hope to get into and attend Michigan State. The reasons to this are:</h4>
        <ul>
            <Li>Michigan State has a amazing program for students in pre-med classes</Li>
            <li>My cousin goes there so it would be nice to be there with him</li>
            <li>The lab I currently intern at has a partnership program with Michigan State so I would almost be guarenteed a place working in their hospital labs or hospital neurosurgery clinic</li>
            <li>Many very sucessfun neurosurgeons I have spoken with have recommended this school to me for Pre-med</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>For Medical School I hope to get into and attend Wayne State University. The reasns to this are:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Wayne State college has a excellent neurosurgery course which was recommended I take if I wished to become a neurosurgeon </li>
            <li>Its in Detroit so I would be close to home</li>
            <li>Could hopefully get hired and work at Henry Ford Hospital which is where I currently am interning at</li>
        </ul>
        <hr>
        <h3>What job I am aspiring to be and what city/area I hope to practice this profession in:</h3>
        <p>I hope to go into neurosurgery when I get into college. I hopefully will start out as a resident and work my way up to becoming a very well known neurosurgeon in my area.</p>
        <p>I hope to stay in Detroit Michigan</p>
        <hr>
        <h3>My Hobby's and Accomplishments</h3>
        <p>Some of my favorite things to do in my free time are to play video games with my friends and my dad. I also love doing all kinds of water sports and fishing in the summer up at my lake house. But in the winter I dont have as many options as I do in the summer as I do in the winter so I usually love to build legos or go skiing/sledding with my friends and or family.</p>
    <h4>My top accomplishment so far:</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Getting accepted and asked to stay at my internship at Henry Ford Hospital</li>
    </ol>
    <hr>
    <h5>Extra:</h5>
    <p>The reason I chose this color scheme is because I feel like it is just all very relaxing colors and it is very easy to read as the text colors are different enough rom he background color where it still matches but can still be seen very visibily.</p>
